# korean-pronouncer
krpr (korean pronouncer) is a small CLI I made that shows you how to pronounce Korean words / sentences based on the rules found here: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Korean/Advanced_Pronunciation_Rules
I made this to learn Rust in more detail so it's definitely a horrible program. Don't use it for anything important.

HOW TO INSTALL.

DONT KNOW, TODO!


HOW TO USE.

The default mode for krpr is -i, which outputs each word seperately. 
You can specify what mode you want to use by adding a parameter in this format, 
    krpr [-param] (input) 
Input can be a single word or a list of words seperated by spaces.

List of parameters:
    -h  Ignores all input and displays help.
    -i  Displays each word that is seperated by a space as its own word rather than a full sentence.
    -s  Displays all the input as one sentence.
